The Philadelphia 76ers are entering a crucial offseason after a disappointing playoff exit at the hands of the New York Knicks. Falling short in six games in the first round was a bitter pill to swallow for a team with championship aspirations. Particularly frustrating was the fact that the Knicks managed to win the series without [Julius Randle](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/randlju01.html) or a fully healthy [OG Anunoby](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anunoog01.html). On top of that, the Knicks have already made waves this offseason by re-signing Anunoby and acquiring [Mikal Bridges](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bridgmi01.html) from the Nets, solidifying their position as a strong contender in the Eastern Conference. While they might lose [Isaiah Hartenstein](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harteis01.html) to free agency or might trade Randle or [Mitchell Robinson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinmi01.html) for roster flexibility, their core is set to challenge for the top spot in the improving Eastern Conference.

Meanwhile, the Boston Celtics, fresh off their championship win, are well-positioned to remain the frontrunners going into next season. With their key rotation intact -- [Jrue Holiday](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/holidjr01.html), [Derrick White](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whitede01.html), [Jaylen Brown](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownja02.html), [Jayson Tatum](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tatumja01.html), [Kristaps Porzingis](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/porzikr01.html), and [Al Horford](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/horfoal01.html) -- they pose a significant hurdle for any Eastern Conference team with championship ambitions.

For the Sixers, this offseason is pivotal. Starting last offseason, Daryl Morey made notable decisions, including not extending [Tyrese Maxey](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01.html) and trading [James Harden](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html) in early November, to prepare for this moment. These moves have positioned the team with a ton of cap space and tradable assets, setting the stage for aggressive roster building. Morey needs to capitalize on this opportunity to build a team around co-stars [Joel Embiid](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01.html) and Tyrese Maxey.

Embiid is coming off another MVP-caliber season, where he averaged 34.7 points per game in the regular season and 33.0 points per game in the postseason, both leading the NBA. Embiid also led all players in the playoffs in on/off rating. Similarly, Maxey is coming off a breakout season, where he won the Most Improved Player award. In games where both Embiid and Maxey suited up, the 76ers had an incredible 29-7 record. However, at 30 years old, with a history of injuries, the urgency to capitalize on Embiid's prime is more pressing than ever. Morey must assemble a roster capable of competing for a championship now, ensuring that Embiid's prime years are not squandered.

As we dive into the Sixers' current salary cap situation and explore their potential moves, it's clear that the stakes have never been higher for Philadelphia. This offseason could very well determine whether the Sixers can rise to the top of the Eastern Conference or remain on the outside looking in.

## Current Cap Situation

- **Guaranteed Salary**
  - Joel Embiid ($51,415,938)

- **Non-Guaranteed Salary**
  - [Paul Reed](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/reedpa01.html) ($7,723,000)
  - [Ricky Council](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/councri01.html) ($1,891,857)

- **Player Options**
  - None

- **Restricted Free Agents**
  - Tyrese Maxey ($8,486,620 qualifying offer / $13,031,760 cap hold): Bird rights

- **Unrestricted Free Agents**
  - [Tobias Harris](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harrito02.html): Bird rights
  - [Buddy Hield](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hieldbu01.html): Bird rights
  - [Nicolas Batum](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/batumni01.html): Bird rights
  - [Robert Covington](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/covinro01.html): Bird rights
  - [De'Anthony Melton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/meltode01.html): Bird rights
  - [Mohamed Bamba](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bambamo01.html): Non-Bird rights
  - [Kyle Lowry](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lowryky01.html): Non-Bird rights
  - [KJ Martin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/martike04.html): Bird rights
  - [Kelly Oubre](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/oubreke01.html): Non-Bird rights
  - [Cameron Payne](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/payneca01.html): Non-Bird rights
  - [Terquavion Smith](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithte01.html): Non-Bird rights

- **Draft Picks**
  - No. 16 overall pick ($4,032,240 cap hold)
  - No. 41 overall pick (no cap hold)

Taking into account Embiid's salary, Maxey's cap hold, the cap hold for the No. 16 overall pick, and rookie-minimum cap holds for nine empty roster spots, the Sixers could generate up to about $62 million in cap room. This figure would rely on renouncing all the team's current free agents and waiving players on non-guaranteed salaries, including Paul Reed and Ricky Council IV, whom we will discuss later. The cap space could rise to nearly $65 million if Philadelphia trades away its first-round pick.

Maxey has had to wait nearly a year for his extension, as Philadelphia has prioritized having cap space for this offseason. The Sixers are definitely expected to extend Maxey to a five-year, $204.5 million extension at some point this summer. However, don't expect this to go through until the Sixers are done making other moves. Philly is allowed to go above the cap by extending Maxey, so they'll do everything else they need before inking him to his max deal.

Embiid and Maxey provide a wonderful starting point, but it's what Morey will do with the rest of the roster that will decide how deep this team can go next season. The stakes are high, and the decisions made in the coming months will shape how competitive the Sixers will be in the improving Eastern Conference.

## Big-Game Hunting

[Daryl Morey and the 76ers are hoping to add one more star player](https://x.com/sixers_galaxy/status/1787597523491643492) around Embiid and Maxey this offseason. The goal is to elevate the team to a championship contender by finding a third star who can complement their dynamic duo. But, who are the options and what does this look like?

[Paul George](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html) is by far the most talked about free agent when it comes to the 76ers, especially after he and Embiid were seen [joking and smiling](https://x.com/JakeMarc23/status/1801771700050080217) on NBA Countdown before Game 4 of the NBA Finals. George is intriguing for a variety of reasons. Firstly, he's an unrestricted free agent, meaning Philly wouldn't have to give up assets in order to acquire him. Secondly, he fills a Tobias Harris-sized role on the wing but is a clear upgrade over Harris. George, an eight-time All-Star, averaged 22.6 points on 41.3% from three, shooting eight threes a game last year. Thirdly, he's also a phenomenal defender, and the Sixers desperately need perimeter defense this offseason.

However, recent reports state that the Sixers' interest in George [has waned](https://x.com/ShamsCharania/status/1803894746026295299). Additionally, if George were to leave the Clippers this offseason, the idea that it would be through a sign-and-trade has gained steam recently. This scenario would mean the Sixers would need to give up valuable assets in order to acquire him. Furthermore, George isn't without his drawbacks. At 34 years old, he has had multiple significant injuries in recent seasons. Reports also indicate that he wants a four-year max deal worth $212.2 million, which is quite a lot for a 34-year-old who is often injured.

Another intriguing option for the Sixers is [Jimmy Butler](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/butleji01.html). The idea that Butler has played his last game for the Miami Heat has been floated around quite a bit, and there's a decent probability he could be traded by the start of the season. There's an obvious link between him and Philly, as he played for the 76ers during the 2018-19 season and is very close with Embiid. However, Butler, like George, is 34 years old and has had a significant injury history. While he certainly provides the scoring punch you'd want in a third star and has proven to be a valuable player in the playoffs, his fit next to Maxey and Embiid is questionable. Last season, Butler only took 2.4 threes per game, although he shot a career-best 41.4%. This limited outside shooting could potentially disrupt the spacing that is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of both Embiid and Maxey.

Two options that would undoubtedly excite fans but seem highly unlikely, if not impossible, are [LeBron James](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) and [Kevin Durant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html).

For James, it would be shocking if he were to leave the Lakers. Although he has a player option on his deal and could test free agency, the odds of him leaving Los Angeles, especially if the Lakers draft Bronny tonight, seem very low. LeBron has built a life in LA, both on and off the court, and the prospect of playing with his son would likely keep him rooted with the Lakers.

On the Durant side, there have been rumors that the Suns could blow it up after what could be called a failed experiment with Durant, [Devin Booker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bookede01.html), and [Bradley Beal](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bealbr01.html). Although Durant would be a perfect fit next to Maxey and Embiid, I struggle to see how Morey could win the Durant bidding war as the Sixers lack the young talent that other suitors have, like Houston, Dallas, or Orlando. Durant's elite scoring ability and playoff experience would undoubtedly elevate the Sixers, but the practicalities of such a move make it a distant dream.

Landing one of these four would give the 76ers one of, if not the most talented big three in the NBA. However, this would also severely limit their opportunity to make upgrades on the margins. If recent NBA champions like the Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics tell you anything, it's that high-level role players are extremely valuable. The days of building a stacked superteam with three or more All-NBA caliber players and filling out the rest of your roster with minimum contracts may be over. For that reason, Morey and the Sixers may look elsewhere.

[Lauri Markkanen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/markkla01.html) would be an almost perfect fit next to Embiid. He spaces the floor, plays defense, and at 27 years old, fits the timeline of the Sixers' core. After a potential trade for him, the Sixers would still have $45 million in cap space. However, the asking price from Danny Ainge and the Utah Jazz is reportedly very high, and it probably increased after the Knicks just gave up five first-round picks for Bridges. This makes the likelihood of acquiring Markkanen quite low, despite the ideal fit.

[Zach LaVine](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lavinza01.html) is another player who has been linked to the Sixers, especially with the Bulls trading [Alex Caruso](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/carsula01.html) to the Thunder last week, indicating a possible rebuild. However, LaVine's contract is atrocious, and there are significant questions about how he'd fit next to Maxey since he's a poor defender and a volume shot-taker. While LaVine can provide scoring, the defensive liabilities and his contract make this a less appealing option.

[Brandon Ingram](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/ingrabr01.html) seems like the most likely outcome at this moment after recent reports have suggested that the Pelicans are shifting their focus towards building around [Zion Williamson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willizi01.html) and the young wing duo of [Herb Jones](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/joneshe01.html) and [Trey Murphy III](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/murphtr02.html). Although many Philly fans rightfully question the fit, fearing it might be another Tobias Harris situation with a low-volume three-point shooter who takes a lot of mid-range shots and isn't great on defense, there's potential for new 76ers coach Nick Nurse to unlock Ingram's three-point shot and defensive capabilities. At only 26 years old and already an All-Star, Ingram has significant upside. Additionally, the Pelicans' asking price in a trade is likely to be lower than other options mentioned, allowing Philly to preserve some assets. He's set to make $36 million next season, which means the Sixers would still have cap space to sign high-quality role players around their new big three.

These potential additions each come with their own set of challenges and benefits. While adding any of these players could significantly impact the Sixers' performance, Morey will need to carefully consider the fit, cost, and long-term implications of each potential acquisition.

## Run It Back

The biggest name on the roster last year set to hit free agency in a couple of weeks is Tobias Harris. Signing Harris to a max contract in the 2019 offseason has turned out to be one of the worst moves in recent NBA history. He's been an awful third option next to Maxey and Embiid, and notably scored zero points on just two shot attempts in the Game 6 loss vs. the Knicks this season. Many Sixers fans, including myself, will be happy to see him walk. He is one player we can be confident and happy to not see return.

Recent reports suggest that the 76ers are expected to re-sign Nicolas Batum, Kyle Lowry, and Kelly Oubre. Batum, although aging, provided great defense and playmaking out of the wing slot this past season. He might be a bit more expensive than a veteran's minimum contract and could cost somewhere between $8-10 million a year, but the Sixers should and will be focused on bringing him back. On the Lowry front, a reunion makes perfect sense. Lowry is from Philly and went to school locally at Villanova. He also won an NBA championship with Nick Nurse and provides the grit and veteran locker room presence every team would want, especially since he'll likely only cost a minimum.

The most interesting of these three is Kelly Oubre. Oubre had a rejuvenating season last year, averaging 15.4 points per game, in and out of the starting lineup. He provides a great scoring punch and seems to enjoy himself in Philadelphia. A reunion makes sense for both sides, even if the price tag is a bit higher. If the Sixers could sign him using the standard mid-level exception ($12.9 million next season), that would be a home run, but there's a chance he commands more once hitting the open market.

Two other options some Sixers fans would want to see back in a Philly uniform are Buddy Hield and De'Anthony Melton. When it comes to Hield, he underperformed for the Sixers after being traded for at the deadline. Although he showed some flashes, he didn't live up to the high-volume, knockdown shooter role many were hoping for. If he wants to come back for cheap, the Sixers should certainly be open to the option, but his services will be replaceable.

Melton is an interesting case. He battled injuries throughout the entire season last year. He's a perfect backcourt mate next to Maxey as he brings the point-of-attack defense that Maxey lacks and knocks down open shots. However, it's recently been reported that he might be way more expensive than some fans think. If he's going to sign a deal in the $10-20 million range, it might be too much for Morey to muster up as they should be valuing health and availability.

The Sixers also have two non-guaranteed contracts: Paul Reed and Ricky Council IV. Paul Reed is set to make $7.7 million next year, but throughout his tenure as a Sixer, he's been underwhelming as a backup center for Embiid. During the playoffs, he looked unplayable at times, so it might be best for the Sixers to let him go, but they could also pick up his option and use him as salary in a trade.

Council, on the other hand, should be kept. He's cheap at only $1.9 million and could step into rotation minutes this year with all the moving pieces. As an undrafted rookie last year, he showed significant promise when given the opportunity, so the Sixers should be inclined to keep him and give him more minutes, especially given his low price tag.

In summary, while some departures are welcomed, strategic re-signings and decisions on existing contracts are crucial for filling out the rotation. Bringing back key contributors like Batum, Lowry, and Oubre, while making careful decisions on Reed and Council, will be vital in shaping the Sixers' roster for next season.

## Filling Out the Edges

Whoever the Sixers sign as role players will be completely based on what third star they add, as this will control how much cap space they have available. The goal is to build a well-rounded roster that complements the star power of Embiid, Maxey, and the potential third star.

The potential backcourt mates next to Maxey will be crucial. The biggest potential addition here is [Kentavious Caldwell-Pope](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/caldwke01.html). He's a great three-point shooter and a lockdown perimeter defender who doesn't need the ball in his hands, making him an ideal fit. Other players who could fill similar roles, though with more flaws, include [Klay Thompson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html), [Gary Trent Jr.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/trentga02.html), [Immanuel Quickley](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/q/quickim01.html), and [Bruce Brown](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownbr01.html).

The Sixers' most significant need is for versatile wings. [Naji Marshall](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/marshna01.html) has been the most mentioned option, bringing a blend of physicality and defense that could be an awesome acquisition, especially if he improves his three-point shooting. Other potential options include [Caleb Martin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/martica02.html), [Patrick Williams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willipa01.html), [Kyle Anderson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anderky01.html), and [Malik Beasley](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beaslma01.html), all of whom could provide valuable minutes and versatility on both ends of the court.

A crucial addition for the Sixers will be a backup center for Embiid. The minutes without Embiid on the floor have been a significant weakness, and the Sixers need to address this gap. [Andre Drummond](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/drumman01.html) is the biggest name mentioned by Sixers fans. He's been the best backup Embiid has had in the past, so an affordable reunion makes sense. Other options include [Kevon Looney](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/looneke01.html) and [Jonas Valanciunas](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/valanjo01.html), although Valanciunas might be too expensive.

When it comes to bolstering the bench, the Sixers could consider players like [Kris Dunn](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dunnkr01.html), [Monte Morris](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/morrimo01.html), and [Tyus Jones](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jonesty01.html) for the backcourt. On the wing, [Torrey Craig](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/craigto01.html), [Taurean Prince](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/princta02.html), [Marcus Morris](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/morrima03.html), and [Jae Crowder](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/crowdja01.html) are solid options who can provide depth and experience.

The Sixers could also explore potential trade candidates who could be extremely valuable as role players. With the Nets trading Mikal Bridges, they are likely looking to move [Dorian Finney-Smith](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/finnedo01.html) and [Cameron Johnson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsca02.html) for draft picks. Both would be great additions to the wing. Johnson is an excellent shooter but comes with a high price tag due to his injury history, while Finney-Smith brings great defensive versatility and consistent shooting.

The Sixers could also look to make a deal with the Wizards, who are in the midst of a full rebuild. [Kyle Kuzma](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kuzmaky01.html) could be an interesting option, as he was an extremely valuable rotational player for the Lakers during their 2020 championship run. [Deni Avdija](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/avdijde01.html) would be a slam dunk acquisition, but the Wizards might want to keep him as part of their young core. [Corey Kispert](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kispeco01.html) could also be considered as an off-ball shooter.

Lastly, the Sixers could look to Portland for potential acquisitions. [Malcolm Brogdon](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brogdma01.html), with his experience in the backcourt, or [Jerami Grant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grantje01.html), with his athleticism in the frontcourt, could both be valuable additions to the roster.

The Sixers hold the number 16 and 41 picks in the 2024 NBA Draft. Although many think they'll trade these picks for win-now pieces, there are some interesting options in both rounds. In the first round, the Sixers could likely target Jared McCain, a sharpshooter out of Duke who could provide immediate spacing and shooting gravity. They could also target Tristan Da Silva, a 23-year-old forward who should be able to compete for rotational minutes immediately as an experienced forward with a great build and high-level shooting ability. Devin Carter and Rob Dillingham are other intriguing guard options should they fall.

At pick 41, there are many routes the Sixers could take, but two I'm high on are Kevin McCullar out of Kansas and Harrison Ingram out of UNC. Both of these forwards are physical and experienced and have glue-guy skills that could help a competing team immediately.

If the Sixers hold on to their picks, it's especially important for the front office to nail them, as recent Finals teams have received immediate contributions from their rookies, such as the Mavericks this year with [Dereck Lively](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/livelde01.html) and the Nuggets the last year with [Christian Braun](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/braunch01.html).

No matter what direction Philadelphia goes with its cap space, it will be crucial for the team to nail its minimum-salary signings once its cap space dries up. This was one of the Suns' issues this past season -- they signed eight players to minimum-salary contracts last summer, but fewer than half of them earned regular minutes. The Sixers will aim to do better with the back half of their roster.

The Sixers have a critical offseason ahead, and the decisions made will shape their competitive landscape for years to come. Balancing the addition of a third star with the need for quality role players will be essential in building a championship-caliber team around Embiid and Maxey.
