## A Long Time Coming

As a DC native and lifelong Wizards fan, I've come to accept a certain level of heartbreak. Whether it was Gilbert Arenas's knee, John Wall's Achilles, or the countless seasons spent spinning our wheels in mediocrity, the Wizards have spent the better part of two decades trapped in basketball purgatory. Since 2018, the team has made the playoffs just once -- in 2021, when Russell Westbrook briefly brought his chaos magic to town -- and even then, they bowed out in five games. In fact, the franchise has made it past the first round of the playoffs only three times this century.

For most of that time, the front office operated with no real vision. No move better summed up that dysfunction than the decision in 2022 to give Bradley Beal a 5-year, $251 million supermax contract, with a full no-trade clause. Not a partial clause. Not a list of teams. A full veto over any deal. Beal became just the second player in the entire NBA with that level of control -- the other being LeBron James. Beal, while a talented scorer, was already 29, had never made an All-NBA First Team, and the Wizards were nowhere close to contending. It was a desperate attempt to cling to star power, rather than face the hard truth that a rebuild was necessary.

But finally, the tide is turning.

In 2023, the Wizards brought in Will Dawkins, a Sam Presti disciple and key architect of the OKC Thunder's rebuild, as General Manager. In 2024, Brian Keefe took over as head coach. For the first time in years, the Wizards have a direction. They're not trying to sneak into the play-in tournament or overpay middling stars. They're starting from scratch, the right way: stockpiling picks, developing young talent, and committing to a culture of growth and patience.

For the first time in a long time, there's a plan in place -- and it actually makes sense.

## The Young Core: A Foundation for the Future

When you're rebuilding in today's NBA, you need more than just draft picks -- you need to hit on them. The Wizards haven't just embraced the rebuild; they've gone all-in, and the early returns are promising. Between savvy draft-day moves and opportunistic trades, Washington now boasts one of the deepest, most intriguing collections of young talent in the league.

Let's break it down by position:

- **Guards**
  - **Tre Johnson** (Age: 19, Draft: 2025 #6) -- The most offensively gifted player on the roster, Johnson brings a rare blend of shot creation, footwork, and scoring instincts that give him true offensive superstar potential. He can get buckets at all three levels and already looks comfortable with the ball in his hands.
  - **Bub Carrington** (Age: 19, Draft: 2024 #14) -- A tall, fluid point guard with advanced vision and feel. Carrington is being groomed as the team's long-term lead guard, and the front office is giving him every opportunity to develop through real NBA reps, starting with heavy usage in Summer League.
  - **AJ Johnson** (Age: 20, Draft: 2024 #23 -- Acquired from Bucks for Kyle Kuzma) -- Explosive and shifty, Johnson is a high-upside project with twitchy athleticism and serious shot creation flashes. For a late first-round pick acquired by flipping a veteran, he represents a swing worth taking.

- **Wings**
  - **Bilal Coulibaly** (Age: 20, Draft: 2023 #7) -- Already a defensive weapon, Coulibaly uses his wingspan and instincts to disrupt passing lanes and guard multiple positions. His offensive game is still developing, but the defensive ceiling is extremely high.
  - **Kyshawn George** (Age: 21, Draft: 2024 #24) -- George fits the mold of the modern 3-and-D wing: versatile, smart, and smooth. He's got a clean shooting stroke and the physical tools to guard multiple positions. The type of plug-and-play role player every good team needs.
  - **Will Riley** (Age: 19, Draft: 2025 #21) -- One of the youngest players in his class, Riley is a raw but tantalizing athlete. He's already shown glimpses of explosive shot creation and high-level scoring instincts.
  - **Jamir Watkins** (Age: 24, Draft: 2025 #42) -- A mature, do-it-all wing with defensive toughness, rebounding instincts, and a competitive edge. Watkins may not have the highest ceiling, but he brings a strong foundation for rotation minutes right away.
  - **Cam Whitmore** (Age: 21, Draft: 2023 #20 -- Acquired from Rockets for two second-round picks) -- Whitmore is a walking bucket. His combination of strength, burst, and scoring mentality gives him real star upside. Getting a player of his caliber for just two second-round picks is one of the savviest moves this front office has made.
  - **Dillon Jones** (Age: 23, Draft: 2024 #26 -- Acquired from Thunder for essentially nothing) -- A jack-of-all-trades forward with a strong frame and advanced feel. He rebounds, defends, and moves the ball well -- a winning player with upside as a rotation staple.

- **Bigs**
  - **Alex Sarr** (Age: 20, Draft: 2024 #2) -- The centerpiece of the rebuild. At 7'1" with elite mobility, Sarr already shows flashes of dominant defense: switchability, rim protection, and shot disruption. His floor is high, and if he continues to develop, he projects as a perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate.
  - **Tristan Vukcevic** (Age: 22, Draft: 2023 #42) -- A stretch big with touch and feel. Vukcevic gives the Wizards spacing in the frontcourt and has the potential to complement Sarr as a pick-and-pop partner or second-unit offensive weapon.

Taken together, this is one of the deepest young rosters in the league, and a clear sign of how aggressively the Wizards have leaned into the rebuild. They now have 7 first-round picks from just the past two drafts on the roster, and 11 first-rounders from the last four drafts when you include recent trade acquisitions Malaki Branham and Blake Wesley. That kind of youth density isn't just rare, it's intentional. Washington isn't hoarding prospects for the sake of it; they're building a developmental ecosystem where players grow together, compete for minutes, and elevate the standard internally. It's a long game, but it's the right one.

## Veteran Leadership & Trade Chips: Smart Moves, On and Off the Court

For a rebuilding team, veterans often serve one of two purposes: they either clog up developmental minutes or they help set the tone. The Wizards have chosen the latter, and done so with impressive precision.

Over the past year, Washington brought in CJ McCollum, Marcus Smart, and Khris Middleton, not to chase wins, but to build culture. These are battle-tested veterans -- former All-Stars, champions, and respected locker room voices -- who know what professionalism looks like at the highest level. Their role isn't to carry the offense or take away shots from the young guys. It's to mentor, guide, and elevate the standard.

CJ McCollum gives young guards like Bub Carrington and Tre Johnson a blueprint for how to succeed in the league. He's a cerebral scorer, a former NBPA president, and someone who can show Carrington how to lead without dominating. Marcus Smart brings championship pedigree and relentless intensity. No one in the league is better equipped to teach Bilal Coulibaly and Kyshawn George the nuances of defensive versatility and winning effort. His voice carries weight, and so does his example. Khris Middleton, a silky mid-range scorer and two-time All-Star, adds a level of polish and spacing that complements young wings while providing a professional model of shot selection and team-first play.

But here's where the front office has really played this right: all three veterans are on expiring contracts, giving the team maximum flexibility. Middleton, Smart, and McCollum's deals are up after this season, making them valuable trade chips at the deadline or clean exits off the books next summer. It's the exact blueprint the Wizards used to turn Kyle Kuzma into AJ Johnson last year: move veterans at peak value, create cap space, and add to the asset pool.

That's what makes this approach so modern, and so smart. The Wizards are leveraging their cap space, not to overpay for empty-calorie stats, but to absorb salary and pick up assets along the way. Take the Jordan Poole for CJ McCollum swap, for example. Poole still had two more guaranteed years on his deal and clearly didn't fit the team's timeline. By flipping him for McCollum, the Wizards not only got an expiring contract and a respected veteran voice, they also picked up additional draft compensation. It was a textbook move: clear the books, improve the culture, and add to the asset chest.

In today's NBA, rebuilding is just as much about managing contracts as it is about developing players. And right now, the Wizards are doing both at a high level.

## Draft Capital Arsenal: Loaded for the Future

A successful rebuild doesn't just depend on the players you draft, it depends on when you draft, how many chances you give yourself, and whether your front office knows how to extract value from the margins. The Wizards, for once, are checking all three boxes.

Washington's draft pick situation is as promising as any non-contending team in the league. Their own 2026 first-round pick is top-8 protected, which means there's a very real incentive to continue prioritizing development and letting the young core take its lumps. And that pick could come at just the right time: the 2026 NBA Draft is shaping up to be a generational class.

The top three prospects -- Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa, and Cameron Boozer -- all project as franchise altering players. Any one of them would immediately become the number one option in Washington and serve as a defining turning point in the rebuild. Beyond that trio, the class is stacked with high-upside talent: Nate Ament, Mikel Brown, and Jayden Quaintance all carry All-Star potential. This makes the Wizards' goal clear: be bad enough to stay in the top 8 and give yourself a shot at one of these cornerstones.

And even if lottery luck doesn't go their way, they've got a second first-round pick coming in 2026, via a pick swap that gives them the worst of Houston, Oklahoma City, or the Clippers. Although this pick isn't projected to be high, as both OKC and Houston have title aspirations, it gives Washington an extra shot at finding value in what may be a stacked first round.

But it's not just first-round picks that matter. The Wizards also own a whopping eight second-rounders in the next two drafts, and they've already shown a willingness to use those picks creatively. This offseason, they sent two seconds to Houston to acquire Cam Whitmore, a 2023 lottery talent who's already looked like a potential stud. They've used second-rounders to move up in the draft, to target overlooked talent, and to grease the wheels of bigger trades. It's a level of optionality that many teams don't have, and Washington is wielding it with purpose.

Perhaps most importantly, this draft flexibility comes at a time when the books are about to clear. The contracts of CJ McCollum, Marcus Smart, and Khris Middleton all expire after the 2025-26 season, giving Washington maximum financial flexibility heading into the 2026 offseason. That perfectly aligns with the arrival of a potential franchise cornerstone from the 2026 draft. By then, the young core will have multiple full seasons of development under their belt, and the front office will be positioned to aggressively pursue top-tier free agents to complement the foundation. The 2026-27 season is shaping up to be the moment everything comes together: where the rebuild stops being theoretical and starts becoming real.

## Smart, Efficient Tanking: Reps > Wins

Rebuilding is never pretty, but when done right, it's purposeful. The Wizards are proving that you don't have to bottom out in chaos. You can tank efficiently, intentionally, and strategically. That's exactly what this front office is doing.

The decisions to move on from Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma weren't just about clearing cap space, they were about clearing the path for the future. Poole, despite his scoring outbursts, never fit the timeline and still had two more years of guaranteed money. Kuzma, a productive veteran, was soaking up usage that needed to be redistributed. By flipping them, the Wizards opened up minutes and on-ball reps for their young players, and brought back real value in the form of AJ Johnson, CJ McCollum, and draft capital.

Now, instead of watching misaligned vets take 20 shots a night, the Wizards are investing in real development. Bub Carrington is learning point guard duties the hard way -- through reps, mistakes, and responsibility. He's getting thrown into situations where he has to read defenses, organize the offense, and lead. It won't always be pretty, but it will matter.

Alex Sarr, meanwhile, is being thrown directly into the fire. The Wizards didn't just hand him a starting role, they gave him no real safety net. With Marvin Bagley III and Tristan Vukcevic as the only other playable bigs, Sarr is learning the NBA game by anchoring the defense, contesting shots, switching on the perimeter, and battling bigger bodies night in and night out. There's no hiding, only growing.

And that might be the point.

Washington's frontcourt depth problem doesn't look like an accident. It's likely a subtle and smart tanking strategy. A thin rotation of big men means fewer rebounds, more defensive breakdowns, and more losses. But those losses come with valuable developmental reps for young players who are being challenged to do more than they're ready for, and that's exactly how you accelerate growth.

This is the OKC and Houston model: prioritize experience over efficiency, let your young core make mistakes, and live with the results. Don't chase wins that don't mean anything. Chase reps. Chase lessons. Chase growth.

The Wizards aren't trying to win 35 games. They're trying to build a team that can win 60 eventually. And every uncomfortable minute for a 19-year-old guard or a 20-year-old big is a down payment on that future.

## Culture Reboot: A New DC Identity

For years, the Washington Wizards felt like a team without a pulse. The culture was reactive, not proactive -- stuck in a cycle of half-measures and hollow optimism. There was no clear philosophy, no sense of identity, and certainly no buzz around the league. But that's starting to change.

The culture shift in DC is real, and it's happening from the top down.

It starts with the organization's investment in infrastructure. Monumental Sports made the decision to keep the team in the city, with new plans for revamping Capital One Arena and building a state-of-the-art practice facility. In a league where training resources and stability can shape a rebuild, that commitment matters, especially to young players deciding where they want to grow.

The Wizards didn't stop there. They turned heads at Summer League this year by building a private practice court in a Las Vegas ballroom, giving their players a dedicated space to train, bond, and build chemistry away from the chaos of the main gyms. That level of attention to detail sends a message: development is the priority.

And the buy-in isn't just coming from coaches and executives, it's coming from players, too. Marcus Smart and Bilal Coulibaly showed up to Vegas, despite not being on the Summer League roster, to support the young guys and help build camaraderie. That kind of presence doesn't happen on accident -- it's a sign that people want to be part of what's being built.

Even more telling? Players around the league are starting to treat Washington like a destination.

Alex Sarr, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 draft, declined a workout with Atlanta, who held the No. 1 pick, because he wanted to come to DC. Cam Whitmore, a DMV native, and his camp worked behind the scenes to engineer a trade home from Houston. Ace Bailey, projected as a top-5 pick in the 2025 draft, reportedly hoped to land in Washington and refused workouts with teams drafting higher, a move that nearly worked, as he ultimately went No. 5 to Utah.

That's not a coincidence. That's momentum. And momentum matters.

After years of listless basketball and lukewarm fan energy, there's finally a feeling of purpose around this team. For the first time in a long time, the fanbase is excited -- not because the Wizards are chasing the 8-seed, but because there's a clear plan, a compelling young core, and an organization doing things the right way. There's a real breath of fresh air in DC, and it's being felt everywhere from the front office to the floor seats.

The Wizards haven't just reset the roster. They've reset the tone.

## A Reason to Believe

For the first time in what feels like forever, being a Wizards fan doesn't mean clinging to false hope or squinting to find upside in mediocrity. It means watching a plan unfold. A real plan: one rooted in long-term vision, player development, and smart asset management.

This team isn't trying to skip steps or slap together a short-term contender. It's embracing the grind. The front office is being patient, deliberate, and forward-thinking. The coaching staff is empowering youth. The veterans are here to guide, not overshadow. And the infrastructure, from private Vegas courts to a revamped arena, reflects a franchise finally investing in itself the right way.

Of course, there are no guarantees in a rebuild. Prospects miss. Picks don't always convey. And growth isn't always linear. But what's different now is that the Wizards are earning their optimism. They're building something sustainable -- not just in terms of talent, but in terms of identity.

As a DC native, I've never felt this way about the team. Not during the Arenas years, not during Wall and Beal's peak, and certainly not during the Poole/Kuzma experiment. For once, it feels like we're not just chasing the next headline or hanging our hopes on one player. We're building something bigger.

It won't happen overnight. But the foundation is there. The pieces are in place. And for the first time in a long time, I can say this with confidence: I love what the Wizards are doing.
