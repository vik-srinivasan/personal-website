March is here. The brackets are about to drop. And if you're not already locked in on what's shaping up to be one of the best NCAA Tournaments in recent memory, let me get you up to speed. This year's field is loaded -- dominant blue bloods, legitimate Cinderellas, and a freshman class that might produce three of the top five picks in the 2026 NBA Draft. Here's everything you need to know.

## The Top Dogs

### Duke Blue Devils (26-2)

This is Cameron Boozer's team, and Cameron Boozer might be the best player in college basketball. The freshman forward is putting up 22.8 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game on a ridiculous 57.5% from the field. Those numbers are absurd for anyone, let alone an 18-year-old. He's the runaway Wooden Award favorite, and barring something catastrophic, he's going to win it.

But Duke isn't just Boozer. Jon Scheyer has built a team with legitimate depth and balance. The Blue Devils defend at an elite level, rebound well, and have multiple guys who can create their own shot. They look like the team to beat, and it's not particularly close.

### Michigan Wolverines (25-2)

Michigan is the most fun team in the country. Dusty May's squad is averaging 90.6 points per game -- 90.6! -- and they do it with pace, spacing, and relentless ball movement. This is a team that runs you off the floor and makes you play at their speed. If you can't keep up, you lose by 20.

The Wolverines don't have a single player as dominant as Boozer, but they have six or seven guys who can go off on any given night. That kind of depth is dangerous in March, where one bad game from your star can end your season. Michigan doesn't have that vulnerability because they don't rely on one guy.

### Arizona Wildcats (26-2)

Arizona has the best one-two punch in the country in Koa Peat and Brayden Burries. Peat is a matchup nightmare at 6'9" who can score from anywhere on the floor, and Burries has been one of the most efficient guards in the nation. Together, they give Arizona two legitimate go-to options in crunch time.

Tommy Lloyd's team is battle-tested, with quality wins stacked up throughout the Pac-12 (yes, I'm still calling it the Pac-12) and non-conference slate. They've got the talent, the coaching, and the experience to make a deep run.

### Houston Cougars

Kelvin Sampson does what Kelvin Sampson always does: defends at an elite level and grinds games to a halt. Houston might not be the most exciting team to watch, but they're terrifyingly effective. They suffocate you defensively, dominate the glass, and make every possession feel like a war. In a single-elimination tournament, that style of play is incredibly dangerous. Don't sleep on the Cougars.

## The Fourth No. 1 Seed Race

The battle for the last No. 1 seed is one of the best storylines heading into Selection Sunday. UConn, Purdue, and Iowa State are all making compelling cases.

UConn is going for the three-peat under Dan Hurley, and while this year's team isn't as dominant as the last two, the Huskies still have championship DNA baked into the program. They know how to win in March better than anyone in the country right now.

Purdue is back with another loaded roster after last year's title game heartbreak. The Boilermakers have the size and physicality to bully just about anyone in the country, and they've been on a tear in Big Ten play.

Iowa State has been one of the most consistent teams all season. T.J. Otzelberger has built a program that plays hard on both ends, shares the ball, and doesn't beat itself. The Cyclones might not have the highest ceiling in the field, but their floor is incredibly high.

My guess? The committee gives it to UConn based on pedigree and overall resume. But any of these three would be a deserving No. 1 seed.

## Cinderella Watch

Every year, some mid-major comes out of nowhere and captures the nation's heart. This year, there are several candidates.

### Saint Louis Billikens

This is the clear top Cinderella. Saint Louis has been playing some of the best basketball in the country over the last month, and they have the kind of balanced roster that can genuinely compete with high-major teams. They shoot it well, defend with intensity, and have multiple upper-classmen who've been through tournament atmospheres before. If they get the right matchup in the first round, watch out. This is the team that could end up in the Sweet 16.

### Nebraska Cornhuskers

Fred Hoiberg started 20-0 at Nebraska. Twenty and zero. In a program that has historically been a basketball afterthought. If he doesn't win Coach of the Year, the award doesn't mean anything. Nebraska has size, shooting, and toughness, and they've beaten quality opponents throughout the Big Ten season. This isn't a fluke -- this is a legitimately good basketball team.

### Miami (OH) RedHawks

28-0. Undefeated. In any conference, going undefeated is an achievement. Miami of Ohio has been perfect all year, and while the MAC isn't the Big 12, winning every single game you play requires something special. They'll come in as a low seed with zero pressure and the kind of confidence that only an undefeated record can bring. Dangerous.

### Yale Bulldogs

The Ivy League is always good for a first-round upset, and this Yale team might be the best the conference has produced in years. The Bulldogs are shooting 41.7% from three as a team -- that's a blistering number that would be elite in any conference. In a one-game, do-or-die scenario, a team that shoots like that can beat anyone. One hot shooting night and a higher-seeded opponent is going home.

### UC San Diego Tritons

This is a great story. UC San Diego is only in its fifth year as a Division I program, and they've gone 30-4. They're still building the infrastructure and the recruiting base to compete with traditional powers, but this year's team is special. A 30-win season this early in their D1 existence is remarkable, and they'll be playing with house money in the tournament. No one expects them to win, which makes them dangerous.

## The Freshman Class

This might be the most talented freshman class in college basketball history. The 2026 NBA Draft implications are enormous -- this group might produce three of the top five picks.

### Cameron Boozer, Duke

I already covered Boozer's numbers, but let me add this: he's not just the best freshman in the country, he might be the best player in college basketball, period. The Wooden Award is his to lose. His combination of size, skill, vision, and efficiency at his age is genuinely unprecedented. He's a lock for the top three in the 2026 draft, and there's a real case that he should go number one. The 22.8/9.9/4.0 stat line on 57.5% shooting is historic.

### AJ Dybantsa, BYU

Dybantsa has been on an absolute tear lately. Over his last seven games, he's averaged 29.1 points per game, highlighted by a 43-point masterpiece against Utah that had NBA scouts losing their minds. He's a 6'8" wing with guard skills, three-level scoring ability, and the kind of shot-creation that translates directly to the NBA. He's the best pure scorer in the freshman class and a likely top-3 pick.

### Darryn Peterson, Kansas

I wrote a whole piece on Peterson, so I'll keep this brief: when healthy, he's the best player in this class. The 19.5 PPG on 47/40/80 splits while hurt is just absurd. The game-winners against Texas Tech, the 32-point game against TCU -- the big moments tell you everything. The injury is the only question mark, and I've already made my feelings clear on that. If he's healthy for the tournament, Kansas is a legitimate title contender.

### Darius Acuff Jr., Texas

Acuff has been one of the most exciting freshmen in the country all season, averaging 23.9 points and 6.8 assists per game. He's an electric scorer and facilitator who plays with a swagger beyond his years. He's risen up draft boards rapidly and is firmly in the lottery conversation. If Texas gets a decent seed, Acuff could have some signature March moments.

### Kingston Flemings, Houston

Flemings doesn't get the headlines that Boozer and Dybantsa get, but he's been instrumental in Houston's success this season. He brings defensive intensity, athleticism, and the kind of two-way versatility that Kelvin Sampson's system demands. He's a projected first-round pick who could climb further with a strong tournament showing.

## My Picks

Time for the bold predictions. I reserve the right to pretend I never wrote these when my bracket inevitably busts.

**Final Four:** Duke, Michigan, Arizona, UConn

I think the four best teams in the country are the four best teams in the country. Sometimes March delivers chaos, but sometimes the cream rises. I'm betting on talent this year.

**National Champion:** Duke

Cameron Boozer is going to will this team to a championship. When you have the best player in the tournament and a coach in Jon Scheyer who's learned from the best (Coach K), you've got the formula. Duke has the star power, the depth, and the defensive chops to cut down the nets.

**Dark Horse:** Nebraska

The Cornhuskers have the look of a team that can make a run. The 20-0 start wasn't a mirage -- this team is genuinely good. If they get favorable seeding and avoid the top two seeds until the Elite Eight, they have the talent and the toughness to get there.

**Breakout Player:** AJ Dybantsa

Dybantsa has been building toward a massive moment all season, and March is the biggest stage in college basketball. I think he goes off in the tournament -- I'm talking 30+ point games, SportsCenter highlight packages, the full treatment. He's got that rare ability to take over a game by himself, and on the tournament stage, that's priceless. By the end of March, the conversation around the number one pick is going to be a lot louder than it is right now.

This freshman class might produce three of the top five picks in the 2026 NBA Draft. Boozer, Dybantsa, and Peterson are all potential franchise-altering talents, and the tournament is their chance to prove it on the biggest stage. Add in the Cinderella potential, the coaching matchups, and the sheer unpredictability of single-elimination basketball, and you've got a recipe for one of the most memorable March Madness tournaments in years.

Set your DVRs. Clear your schedules. Cancel your plans. March is here, and it's going to be special.
