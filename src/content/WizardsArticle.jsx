      <h2>A Long Time Coming</h2>
      <p>
        As a DC native and lifelong Wizards fan, I&rsquo;ve come to accept a
        certain level of heartbreak. Whether it was Gilbert Arenas&rsquo;s knee,
        John Wall&rsquo;s Achilles, or the countless seasons spent spinning our
        wheels in mediocrity, the Wizards have spent the better part of
        two decades trapped in basketball purgatory. Since 2018, the team
        has made the playoffs just once &mdash; in 2021, when Russell Westbrook
        briefly brought his chaos magic to town &mdash; and even then, they
        bowed out in five games. In fact, the franchise has made it past
        the first round of the playoffs only three times this century.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most of that time, the front office operated with no real
        vision. No move better summed up that dysfunction than the
        decision in 2022 to give Bradley Beal a 5-year, $251 million
        supermax contract, with a full no-trade clause. Not a partial
        clause. Not a list of teams. A full veto over any deal. Beal
        became just the second player in the entire NBA with that level of
        control &mdash; the other being LeBron James. Beal, while a talented
        scorer, was already 29, had never made an All-NBA First Team, and
        the Wizards were nowhere close to contending. It was a desperate
        attempt to cling to star power, rather than face the hard truth
        that a rebuild was necessary.
      </p>
      <p>But finally, the tide is turning.</p>
      <p>
        In 2023, the Wizards brought in Will Dawkins, a Sam Presti
        disciple and key architect of the OKC Thunder&rsquo;s rebuild, as
        General Manager. In 2024, Brian Keefe took over as head coach. For
        the first time in years, the Wizards have a direction. They&rsquo;re not
        trying to sneak into the play-in tournament or overpay middling
        stars. They&rsquo;re starting from scratch, the right way: stockpiling
        picks, developing young talent, and committing to a culture of
        growth and patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in a long time, there&rsquo;s a plan in place &mdash; and
        it actually makes sense.
      </p>

      <h2>The Young Core: A Foundation for the Future</h2>
      <p>
        When you&rsquo;re rebuilding in today&rsquo;s NBA, you need more than just
        draft picks &mdash; you need to hit on them. The Wizards haven&rsquo;t just
        embraced the rebuild; they&rsquo;ve gone all-in, and the early returns
        are promising. Between savvy draft-day moves and opportunistic
        trades, Washington now boasts one of the deepest, most intriguing
        collections of young talent in the league.
      </p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s break it down by position:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Guards</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Tre Johnson</strong> (Age: 19, Draft: 2025 #6)
              <br />
              The most offensively gifted player on the roster, Johnson
              brings a rare blend of shot creation, footwork, and scoring
              instincts that give him true offensive superstar potential.
              He can get buckets at all three levels and already looks
              comfortable with the ball in his hands.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bub Carrington</strong> (Age: 19, Draft: 2024 #14)
              <br />
              A tall, fluid point guard with advanced vision and feel.
              Carrington is being groomed as the team&rsquo;s long-term lead
              guard, and the front office is giving him every opportunity
              to develop through real NBA reps, starting with heavy usage
              in Summer League.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AJ Johnson</strong> (Age: 20, Draft: 2024 #23 &ndash; Acquired from Bucks
              for Kyle Kuzma)
              <br />
              Explosive and shifty, Johnson is a high-upside project with
              twitchy athleticism and serious shot creation flashes. For a
              late first-round pick acquired by flipping a veteran, he
              represents a swing worth taking.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wings</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Bilal Coulibaly</strong> (Age: 20, Draft: 2023 #7)
              <br />
              Already a defensive weapon, Coulibaly uses his wingspan and
              instincts to disrupt passing lanes and guard multiple
              positions. His offensive game is still developing, but the
              defensive ceiling is extremely high.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Kyshawn George</strong> (Age: 21, Draft: 2024 #24)
              <br />
              George fits the mold of the modern 3-and-D wing: versatile,
              smart, and smooth. He&rsquo;s got a clean shooting stroke and the
              physical tools to guard multiple positions. The type of
              plug-and-play role player every good team needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Will Riley</strong> (Age: 19, Draft: 2025 #21)
              <br />
              One of the youngest players in his class, Riley is a raw but
              tantalizing athlete. He&rsquo;s a long-term project, but he&rsquo;s
              already shown glimpses of explosive shot creation and
              high-level scoring instincts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jamir Watkins</strong> (Age: 24, Draft: 2025 #42)
              <br />
              A mature, do-it-all wing with defensive toughness,
              rebounding instincts, and a competitive edge. Watkins may
              not have the highest ceiling, but he brings a strong
              foundation for rotation minutes right away.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cam Whitmore</strong> (Age: 21, Draft: 2023 #20 &ndash; Acquired from
              Rockets for two second-round picks)
              <br />
              Whitmore is a walking bucket. His combination of strength,
              burst, and scoring mentality gives him real star upside.
              Getting a player of his caliber for just two second-round
              picks is one of the savviest moves this front office has
              made.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dillon Jones</strong> (Age: 23, Draft: 2024 #26 &ndash; Acquired from
              Thunder for essentially nothing)
              <br />
              A jack-of-all-trades forward with a strong frame and
              advanced feel. He rebounds, defends, and moves the ball well
              &ndash; a winning player with upside as a rotation staple.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bigs</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Alex Sarr</strong> (Age: 20, Draft: 2024 #2)
              <br />
              The centerpiece of the rebuild. At 7&rsquo;1&quot; with elite mobility,
              Sarr already shows flashes of dominant defense:
              switchability, rim protection, and shot disruption. His
              floor is high, and if he continues to develop, he projects
              as a perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tristan Vuk&#269;evi&#263;</strong> (Age: 22, Draft: 2023 #42)
              <br />
              A stretch big with touch and feel. Vuk&#269;evi&#263; gives the
              Wizards spacing in the frontcourt and has the potential to
              complement Sarr as a pick-and-pop partner or second-unit
              offensive weapon.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Taken together, this is one of the deepest young rosters in the
        league, and a clear sign of how aggressively the Wizards have
        leaned into the rebuild. They now have 7 first-round picks from
        just the past two drafts on the roster, and 11 first-rounders from
        the last four drafts when you include recent trade acquisitions
        Malaki Branham and Blake Wesley. That kind of youth density isn&rsquo;t
        just rare, it&rsquo;s intentional. Washington isn&rsquo;t hoarding prospects
        for the sake of it; they&rsquo;re building a developmental ecosystem
        where players grow together, compete for minutes, and elevate the
        standard internally. It&rsquo;s a long game, but it&rsquo;s the right one.
      </p>

      <h2>Veteran Leadership &amp; Trade Chips: Smart Moves, On and Off the Court</h2>
      <p>
        For a rebuilding team, veterans often serve one of two purposes:
        they either clog up developmental minutes or they help set the
        tone. The Wizards have chosen the latter, and done so with
        impressive precision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year, Washington brought in CJ McCollum, Marcus
        Smart, and Khris Middleton, not to chase wins, but to build
        culture. These are battle-tested veterans &mdash; former All-Stars,
        champions, and respected locker room voices &mdash; who know what
        professionalism looks like at the highest level. Their role isn&rsquo;t
        to carry the offense or take away shots from the young guys. It&rsquo;s
        to mentor, guide, and elevate the standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        CJ McCollum gives young guards like Bub Carrington and Tre Johnson
        a blueprint for how to succeed in the league. He&rsquo;s a cerebral
        scorer, a former NBPA president, and someone who can show
        Carrington how to lead without dominating. Marcus Smart brings
        championship pedigree and relentless intensity. No one in the
        league is better equipped to teach Bilal Coulibaly and Kyshawn
        George the nuances of defensive versatility and winning effort.
        His voice carries weight, and so does his example. Khris
        Middleton, a silky mid-range scorer and two-time All-Star, adds a
        level of polish and spacing that complements young wings while
        providing a professional model of shot selection and team-first
        play.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here&rsquo;s where the front office has really played this right:
        all three veterans are on expiring contracts, giving the team
        maximum flexibility. Middleton, Smart, and McCollum&rsquo;s deals are up
        after this season, making them valuable trade chips at the
        deadline or clean exits off the books next summer. It&rsquo;s the exact
        blueprint the Wizards used to turn Kyle Kuzma into AJ Johnson last
        year: move veterans at peak value, create cap space, and add to
        the asset pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s what makes this approach so modern, and so smart. The
        Wizards are leveraging their cap space, not to overpay for
        empty-calorie stats, but to absorb salary and pick up assets along
        the way. Take the Jordan Poole for CJ McCollum swap, for example.
        Poole still had two more guaranteed years on his deal and clearly
        didn&rsquo;t fit the team&rsquo;s timeline. By flipping him for McCollum, the
        Wizards not only got an expiring contract and a respected veteran
        voice, they also picked up additional draft compensation. It was a
        textbook move: clear the books, improve the culture, and add to
        the asset chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today&rsquo;s NBA, rebuilding is just as much about managing
        contracts as it is about developing players. And right now, the
        Wizards are doing both at a high level.
      </p>

      <h2>Draft Capital Arsenal: Loaded for the Future</h2>
      <p>
        A successful rebuild doesn&rsquo;t just depend on the players you draft,
        it depends on when you draft, how many chances you give yourself,
        and whether your front office knows how to extract value from the
        margins. The Wizards, for once, are checking all three boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Washington&rsquo;s draft pick situation is as promising as any
        non-contending team in the league. Their own 2026 first-round pick
        is top-8 protected, which means there&rsquo;s a very real incentive to
        continue prioritizing development and letting the young core take
        its lumps. And that pick could come at just the right time: the
        2026 NBA Draft is shaping up to be a generational class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top three prospects &mdash; Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa, and
        Cameron Boozer &mdash; all project as franchise altering players. Any
        one of them would immediately become the number one option in
        Washington and serve as a defining turning point in the rebuild.
        Beyond that trio, the class is stacked with high-upside talent:
        Nate Ament, Mikel Brown, and Jayden Quaintance all carry All-Star
        potential. This makes the Wizards&rsquo; goal clear: be bad enough to
        stay in the top 8 and give yourself a shot at one of these
        cornerstones.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if lottery luck doesn&rsquo;t go their way, they&rsquo;ve got a
        second first-round pick coming in 2026, via a pick swap that gives
        them the worst of Houston, Oklahoma City, or the Clippers.
        Although this pick isn&rsquo;t projected to be high, as both OKC and
        Houston have title aspirations, it gives Washington an extra shot
        at finding value in what may be a stacked first round.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it&rsquo;s not just first-round picks that matter. The Wizards also
        own a whopping eight second-rounders in the next two drafts, and
        they&rsquo;ve already shown a willingness to use those picks creatively.
        This offseason, they sent two seconds to Houston to acquire Cam
        Whitmore, a 2023 lottery talent who&rsquo;s already looked like a
        potential stud. They&rsquo;ve used second-rounders to move up in the
        draft, to target overlooked talent, and to grease the wheels of
        bigger trades. It&rsquo;s a level of optionality that many teams don&rsquo;t
        have, and Washington is wielding it with purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps most importantly, this draft flexibility comes at a time
        when the books are about to clear. The contracts of CJ McCollum,
        Marcus Smart, and Khris Middleton all expire after the 2025&ndash;26
        season, giving Washington maximum financial flexibility heading
        into the 2026 offseason. That perfectly aligns with the arrival of
        a potential franchise cornerstone from the 2026 draft. By then,
        the young core will have multiple full seasons of development
        under their belt, and the front office will be positioned to
        aggressively pursue top-tier free agents to complement the
        foundation. The 2026&ndash;27 season is shaping up to be the moment
        everything comes together: where the rebuild stops being
        theoretical and starts becoming real.
      </p>

      <h2>Smart, Efficient Tanking: Reps &gt; Wins</h2>
      <p>
        Rebuilding is never pretty, but when done right, it&rsquo;s purposeful.
        The Wizards are proving that you don&rsquo;t have to bottom out in
        chaos. You can tank efficiently, intentionally, and strategically.
        That&rsquo;s exactly what this front office is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decisions to move on from Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma weren&rsquo;t
        just about clearing cap space, they were about clearing the path
        for the future. Poole, despite his scoring outbursts, never fit
        the timeline and still had two more years of guaranteed money.
        Kuzma, a productive veteran, was soaking up usage that needed to
        be redistributed. By flipping them, the Wizards opened up minutes
        and on-ball reps for their young players, and brought back real
        value in the form of AJ Johnson, CJ McCollum, and draft capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, instead of watching misaligned vets take 20 shots a night,
        the Wizards are investing in real development. Bub Carrington is
        learning point guard duties the hard way &mdash; through reps, mistakes,
        and responsibility. He&rsquo;s getting thrown into situations where he
        has to read defenses, organize the offense, and lead. It won&rsquo;t
        always be pretty, but it will matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alex Sarr, meanwhile, is being thrown directly into the fire. The
        Wizards didn&rsquo;t just hand him a starting role, they gave him no
        real safety net. With Marvin Bagley III and Tristan Vuk&#269;evi&#263; as
        the only other playable bigs, Sarr is learning the NBA game by
        anchoring the defense, contesting shots, switching on the
        perimeter, and battling bigger bodies night in and night out.
        There&rsquo;s no hiding, only growing.
      </p>
      <p>And that might be the point.</p>
      <p>
        Washington&rsquo;s frontcourt depth problem doesn&rsquo;t look like an
        accident. It&rsquo;s likely a subtle and smart tanking strategy. A thin
        rotation of big men means fewer rebounds, more defensive
        breakdowns, and more losses. But those losses come with valuable
        developmental reps for young players who are being challenged to
        do more than they&rsquo;re ready for, and that&rsquo;s exactly how you
        accelerate growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the OKC and Houston model: prioritize experience over
        efficiency, let your young core make mistakes, and live with the
        results. Don&rsquo;t chase wins that don&rsquo;t mean anything. Chase reps.
        Chase lessons. Chase growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wizards aren&rsquo;t trying to win 35 games. They&rsquo;re trying to build
        a team that can win 60 eventually. And every uncomfortable minute
        for a 19-year-old guard or a 20-year-old big is a down payment on
        that future.
      </p>

      <h2>Culture Reboot: A New DC Identity</h2>
      <p>
        For years, the Washington Wizards felt like a team without a
        pulse. The culture was reactive, not proactive &mdash; stuck in a cycle
        of half-measures and hollow optimism. There was no clear
        philosophy, no sense of identity, and certainly no buzz around the
        league. But that&rsquo;s starting to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The culture shift in DC is real, and it&rsquo;s happening from the top
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        It starts with the organization&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure.
        Monumental Sports made the decision to keep the team in the city,
        with new plans for revamping Capital One Arena and building a
        state-of-the-art practice facility. In a league where training
        resources and stability can shape a rebuild, that commitment
        matters, especially to young players deciding where they want to
        grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wizards didn&rsquo;t stop there. They turned heads at Summer League
        this year by building a private practice court in a Las Vegas
        ballroom, giving their players a dedicated space to train, bond,
        and build chemistry away from the chaos of the main gyms. That
        level of attention to detail sends a message: development is the
        priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the buy-in isn&rsquo;t just coming from coaches and executives, it&rsquo;s
        coming from players, too. Marcus Smart and Bilal Coulibaly showed
        up to Vegas, despite not being on the Summer League roster, to
        support the young guys and help build camaraderie. That kind of
        presence doesn&rsquo;t happen on accident &mdash; it&rsquo;s a sign that people want
        to be part of what&rsquo;s being built.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more telling? Players around the league are starting to treat
        Washington like a destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alex Sarr, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 draft, declined a
        workout with Atlanta, who held the No. 1 pick, because he wanted
        to come to DC. Cam Whitmore, a DMV native, and his camp worked
        behind the scenes to engineer a trade home from Houston. Ace
        Bailey, projected as a top-5 pick in the 2025 draft, reportedly
        hoped to land in Washington and refused workouts with teams
        drafting higher, a move that nearly worked, as he ultimately went
        No. 5 to Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s not a coincidence. That&rsquo;s momentum. And momentum matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        After years of listless basketball and lukewarm fan energy,
        there&rsquo;s finally a feeling of purpose around this team. For the
        first time in a long time, the fanbase is excited &mdash; not because
        the Wizards are chasing the 8-seed, but because there&rsquo;s a clear
        plan, a compelling young core, and an organization doing things
        the right way. There&rsquo;s a real breath of fresh air in DC, and it&rsquo;s
        being felt everywhere from the front office to the floor seats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wizards haven&rsquo;t just reset the roster. They&rsquo;ve reset the tone.
      </p>

      <h2>A Reason to Believe</h2>
      <p>
        For the first time in what feels like forever, being a Wizards fan
        doesn&rsquo;t mean clinging to false hope or squinting to find upside in
        mediocrity. It means watching a plan unfold. A real plan: one
        rooted in long-term vision, player development, and smart asset
        management.
      </p>
      <p>
        This team isn&rsquo;t trying to skip steps or slap together a short-term
        contender. It&rsquo;s embracing the grind. The front office is being
        patient, deliberate, and forward-thinking. The coaching staff is
        empowering youth. The veterans are here to guide, not overshadow.
        And the infrastructure, from private Vegas courts to a revamped
        arena, reflects a franchise finally investing in itself the right
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there are no guarantees in a rebuild. Prospects miss.
        Picks don&rsquo;t always convey. And growth isn&rsquo;t always linear. But
        what&rsquo;s different now is that the Wizards are earning their
        optimism. They&rsquo;re building something sustainable &mdash; not just in
        terms of talent, but in terms of identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a DC native, I&rsquo;ve never felt this way about the team. Not
        during the Arenas years, not during Wall and Beal&rsquo;s peak, and
        certainly not during the Poole/Kuzma experiment. For once, it
        feels like we&rsquo;re not just chasing the next headline or hanging our
        hopes on one player. We&rsquo;re building something bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
        It won&rsquo;t happen overnight. But the foundation is there. The pieces
        are in place. And for the first time in a long time, I can say
        this with confidence: I love what the Wizards are doing.
