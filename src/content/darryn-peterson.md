I'm going to say something that apparently needs to be said, because the discourse around the 2026 NBA Draft has gone completely off the rails: Darryn Peterson should be the number one pick. Full stop. End of discussion. I don't care about the injury concerns. I don't care about the games missed. I don't care what Stephen A. Smith yelled on First Take last week. You take the best player in the draft, and Darryn Peterson is the best player in the draft.

Let me be very clear about something before we go any further: Peterson is genuinely hurt. This is not load management. This is not a kid taking nights off because he doesn't feel like playing in a Tuesday game at Iowa State. The reports of IV treatments before games are real. The video breakdowns showing diminished explosiveness compared to his high school tape are real. Bill Self's genuine surprise when Peterson can't suit up for games he was expected to play in -- that's real. This is a 19-year-old kid fighting through a legitimate injury to compete for a Kansas team that needs him.

And he's missed 11 of 28 games because of it. Eleven games. That's significant. I'm not going to pretend it isn't.

But here's where the conversation gets stupid: people are using the games missed as a reason to pass on him. They're pointing at the absences and treating them as some sort of character flaw or long-term red flag. And in doing so, they're completely ignoring what he's done in the 17 games he has played.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Let's talk about what Darryn Peterson has done while hurt. Not healthy. While hurt.

19.5 points per game. 47% from the field. 40% from three. 80% from the free throw line.

Read those numbers again. That's elite efficiency at every level. That's a 47/40/80 shooting split as a freshman in the Big 12, one of the toughest conferences in college basketball, while dealing with an injury that has visibly limited his athleticism. Most freshmen struggle to shoot 40% from the field in their first college season. Peterson is doing it on one leg.

And it's not just the raw numbers. It's the moments. The 32-point explosion against TCU that forced overtime. The back-to-back game-winning three-pointers against Texas Tech in the final 81 seconds -- a sequence so absurd it felt like something out of a movie. This kid isn't just putting up stats; he's producing in the moments that matter most. Compromised. Hurt. Still the best player on the floor.

That's not normal. That's not something you can teach or develop. That's the kind of hardwired competitive DNA that separates stars from superstars.

## The Physical Profile

Beyond the production, the physical toolkit is ridiculous. Peterson stands 6'5" with a 6'10" wingspan, giving him the length to guard multiple positions and finish over defenders at the rim. He's a three-level scorer with a silky pull-up jumper, a devastating first step when healthy, and the ability to get to his spots against anyone. The Kobe comparisons might sound like hyperbole, but watch the mid-range game. Watch the footwork. Watch the way he creates separation. The parallels are real.

And he's not just an offensive weapon. Peterson's defensive potential, fueled by that wingspan and his competitive motor, projects as legitimately two-way. He's got the tools to be a plus defender at the NBA level -- something you can't say about every top prospect in this class.

The ceiling here is a franchise-altering, two-way superstar. A player who can be the best player on a championship team. How many prospects in any draft can you say that about?

## The Bad Takes

Stephen A. Smith went on television last week and said -- with his whole chest -- that no team should draft Darryn Peterson first overall. His argument boiled down to: the kid's hurt, you can't trust the durability, it's too risky.

With all due respect, Stephen A., this is one of the worst draft takes in recent memory. And I say that as someone who generally respects the passion he brings to these conversations. But this is wrong. This is the kind of surface-level analysis that gets front offices fired.

Bill Simmons has been pushing the narrative that AJ Dybantsa is the clear-cut number one pick, and while I understand the appeal -- Dybantsa is an incredible prospect in his own right, and his recent stretch of 29.1 points per game over his last seven games, including that 43-point outburst against Utah, has been electric -- the idea that this is some sort of obvious, slam-dunk decision is simply not supported by the tape or the data.

Dybantsa is a terrific prospect. But Peterson, when healthy, is on a different level. The shooting efficiency, the shotmaking in crunch time, the two-way upside -- it all points to Peterson being the superior long-term investment.

## The Injury-Risk Precedent

"But what if the injury is chronic? What if he can never stay healthy?"

I hear you. It's a fair question. But let me offer some historical context.

Joel Embiid missed his first two full NBA seasons with foot injuries. He had played a grand total of 31 games in college at Kansas (funny enough, the same program). The Process nearly became a punchline. Instead, Embiid became an MVP and one of the most dominant players of his generation.

Zion Williamson's injury concerns were well-documented coming out of Duke. His weight, his playing style, the knee issues -- all of it was fair game. And yes, the injuries have been a real problem. But nobody who watched Zion Williamson play would tell you the talent wasn't worth the gamble. When he's on the floor, he's one of the most unstoppable forces in NBA history.

The point isn't that every injured prospect becomes a star. The point is that when the talent is this obvious, this overwhelming, you don't pass on it because of injury risk. You manage the risk. You build a program around protecting the player. You invest in the medical staff and the load management and the long-term development plan. What you don't do is overthink your way into taking a lesser prospect because you're scared.

## The Counter-Arguments

Look, I'll be fair. There are legitimate concerns here. Missing 11 of 28 games is a lot. The nature of the injury hasn't been fully disclosed, which adds uncertainty. And there's always the possibility that Peterson never regains the explosive athleticism he showed in high school, that this version -- the wounded, slightly diminished version -- is closer to what NBA teams will get.

But even this version is putting up 19.5 points per game on 47/40/80 splits in a major conference. Even this version is hitting game-winners in the final minute. Even this version has NBA scouts unanimous in their assessment of his talent ceiling.

And let's not forget Peterson's own words: "Basketball is my life. If I could have been out there every game this year, I would have."

This isn't a kid who's ducking competition. This is a kid who's desperate to compete and physically can't. There's a massive difference.

## The Verdict

Here's the bottom line. In every draft, there's a tension between ceiling and floor, between upside and safety. Teams that consistently err on the side of safety -- that take the "safe" pick over the "best" pick -- end up in the middle of the pack forever. They end up drafting Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic. They end up taking Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan.

The health concerns around Darryn Peterson are real. I'm not dismissing them. But the talent is generational. The shot-making is elite. The physical profile is tailor-made for the modern NBA. And the competitive fire, the ability to perform in the biggest moments while compromised, speaks to something that can't be measured on a medical chart.

You take the talent. You bet on the upside. You build around the generational player and figure out the rest later.

Take Darryn Peterson first. Period.
