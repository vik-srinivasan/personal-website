I wrote last summer that I loved what the Wizards were doing. That the rebuild was real, the direction was clear, and that for the first time in a long time, there was a reason to believe in Washington basketball. I wrote about the young core, the draft capital, the culture shift, the OKC blueprint being executed in real time.

That was before this.

What the Wizards just pulled off at the trade deadline isn't just good asset management. It isn't just "winning the deadline." This is the heist of the decade. And I'm not being hyperbolic. Let me walk you through what just happened, because if you're not paying attention to what's going on in DC, you're missing the most exciting rebuild in the NBA.

## The Trae Young Trade

Let's start here. The Washington Wizards acquired Trae Young -- a four-time All-Star, a 27-year-old elite point guard who averaged 25+ points and 10+ assists in his prime -- for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert.

That's it. No picks. No young players. CJ McCollum, a 33-year-old expiring contract who was brought in specifically to be flipped at the deadline, and Corey Kispert, a solid shooter who was never going to be part of the long-term core. Two guys who weren't in the Wizards' future for a player who could define it.

Trae Young is 27 years old. He fits the timeline of the young core perfectly. He's exactly the kind of star creator that Washington has been missing -- a player who can run a pick-and-roll, draw doubles, and create open looks for everyone around him. Imagine Trae feeding lobs to Alex Sarr. Imagine Trae drawing the defense and kicking to Bilal Coulibaly and Kyshawn George for open threes. Imagine Trae mentoring Bub Carrington, showing him what it looks like to command an offense at the highest level.

And the Wizards gave up nothing of consequence to get him. Nothing. The front office identified McCollum's expiring contract as the perfect salary-matching piece, and they executed. This is what happens when you plan three steps ahead.

## The Anthony Davis Blockbuster

If the Trae Young trade was surgical, the Anthony Davis deal was a masterpiece of complexity. A 9-player, 3-team mega-deal that landed one of the best big men in basketball in Washington.

What did it cost? Let's go through the pieces: Khris Middleton (expiring contract, brought in specifically for this purpose), AJ Johnson, Malaki Branham, Marvin Bagley, two late or protected first-round picks, and three second-round picks. That's it.

Look at that list carefully. Every single one of those players was either an expiring veteran, a fringe rotation piece, or a project who hadn't broken through. Not a single core young player was included. Zero. Sarr? Still here. Coulibaly? Still here. Carrington? Still here. Tre Johnson? Still here. Kyshawn George? Still here. Will Riley? Still here.

The Wizards traded the margins of their roster for Anthony Davis and didn't touch the foundation. That is absurdly difficult to pull off in a deal of this magnitude.

And here's the kicker: not a single one of the Wizards' own first-round picks was included. The picks that went out were acquired assets -- other teams' picks that Washington had stockpiled precisely for a moment like this. The front office spent two years accumulating draft capital as trade currency, and they just spent it on an All-NBA big man without mortgaging their own future. That's next-level asset management.

## The Young Core Is Intact

This is the part that still blows my mind. After acquiring a four-time All-Star point guard and a former MVP candidate center, the Wizards' young core is completely, 100% intact:

- **Alex Sarr** -- The 7'1" centerpiece. Defensive anchor. Potential DPOY candidate.
- **Bilal Coulibaly** -- Elite defensive wing with untapped offensive upside.
- **Bub Carrington** -- The lead guard of the future, now learning behind Trae Young.
- **Tre Johnson** -- Offensive scoring savant. 19 years old. Bucket getter.
- **Kyshawn George** -- 3-and-D wing. Modern NBA prototype.
- **Will Riley** -- Raw but explosive. Long-term project with star upside.

Every single one of them is still on the roster. Every single one of them is still developing. The Wizards didn't sacrifice tomorrow for today -- they found a way to have both.

## Still Positioned for the 2026 Draft

Here's what makes this truly insane: the Wizards are 16-40. They're still one of the worst teams in the league. They're still positioned for a top-5 pick in what might be the most loaded draft class in a decade.

Darryn Peterson. AJ Dybantsa. Cameron Boozer. Any of those three could fall to Washington, and any of them would immediately become a franchise cornerstone alongside the existing core. The Wizards just added Trae Young and Anthony Davis and might still draft a generational talent this summer. Let that sink in.

And the draft capital war chest? Still massive. The Wizards still hold 26 picks through 2032, including 10 first-rounders. They spent some assets to get AD, sure, but they barely made a dent in the overall stockpile. The cupboard is still overflowing.

## The Path Forward

There are two realistic scenarios here, and both are excellent for Washington.

Scenario one: Trae Young works toward a long-term extension. He buys into the culture, loves playing with the young core, and commits to being the veteran star that this group rallies around. A backcourt of Trae Young and Tre Johnson, with Coulibaly on the wing and Sarr protecting the rim, is a legitimately terrifying lineup. Add a top-5 draft pick this summer and you're looking at a playoff team within two years.

Scenario two: Anthony Davis stays healthy and proves he still has elite-level play in him. The Wizards can either keep him for a playoff push or flip him at a future deadline for even more assets. An AD who's healthy and producing has enormous trade value -- we're talking multiple first-rounders from a contender. The optionality is incredible.

And that Sarr-Davis defensive pairing? Even for a few months, the rim protection and switchability of those two together could be devastating. Sarr at 7'1" and Davis at 6'10", both elite shot-blockers who can switch onto guards -- that's a defensive frontcourt that would make any offense uncomfortable.

## What the Experts Are Saying

Sports Illustrated graded the Wizards' deadline: A, A, A-, B+. They called it "the best deadline in the league." Not one of the best. THE best.

And they're right. No team in the NBA improved their short-term talent AND long-term trajectory the way Washington did. Most teams face a binary choice at the deadline: go all-in for now or stockpile for the future. The Wizards somehow did both. They added two All-Star caliber players without sacrificing any of the pieces that matter most.

## The OKC Model, Accelerated

I keep coming back to the OKC comparison because it's so apt. Sam Presti spent years in Oklahoma City stockpiling draft picks, developing young talent, and being patient. He used cap space to absorb unwanted contracts and extract assets. He made shrewd trades that everyone questioned at the time. And then, seemingly overnight, the Thunder went from laughingstock to legitimate title contender.

The Wizards are running the same playbook, but they're doing it faster. Will Dawkins, a Presti disciple, has taken the lessons he learned in OKC and applied them with even more aggression. Instead of waiting five years for the draft picks to mature, he's using the accumulated capital to trade for established stars at a discount -- players other teams need to move because of salary concerns or rebuild timelines.

Trae Young was available because Atlanta needed to reset. Davis was available because the Lakers were imploding. The Wizards were positioned to pounce because they'd spent two years doing the boring, unglamorous work of stockpiling assets and maintaining cap flexibility.

This is what a masterclass rebuild looks like. This is what it looks like when a front office has a plan, executes it with discipline, and has the courage to make big moves when the opportunity arises.

As a DC native, as someone who has suffered through two decades of Wizards basketball, I can't believe what I'm watching. Last summer I said I loved what the Wizards were doing.

Now? Now I'm starting to believe they might actually pull this off.
