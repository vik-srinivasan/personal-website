The NFL has a quarterback problem, and it's getting worse by the day. Not a talent problem -- there's more quarterback talent in the league right now than at any point in history. The problem is money. Specifically, the astronomical, franchise-crippling, roster-destroying contracts that teams keep handing out to quarterbacks who haven't proven they can win the big one. And the evidence is mounting that this approach doesn't just fail to produce championships -- it actively prevents them.

Let's start with the numbers, because the numbers are staggering.

## The Contract Explosion

There are now 11 quarterbacks in the NFL making over $50 million per year. Eleven. Dak Prescott sits at the top at $60 million AAV, with a 2026 cap hit that balloons to a mind-numbing $76.5 million -- roughly 25% of the entire team's salary cap devoted to a single player. One quarter of your cap. For a quarterback who is 2-5 in the playoffs and has exactly zero conference championship appearances.

But Dak isn't even the worst of it.

Deshaun Watson's contract with the Cleveland Browns is the worst in the history of professional sports, and I'm not sure it's particularly close. A fully guaranteed $230 million deal that carries $172 million in dead cap if Cleveland tries to release him. The Browns are handcuffed to a quarterback who has been, by any objective measure, terrible since arriving in Cleveland. He's won 12 games in three seasons. He's thrown for more interceptions than touchdowns in some stretches. And the Browns cannot escape. $172 million in dead money. The franchise is paralyzed.

Then there's Tua Tagovailoa. Miami handed him a $212.4 million extension, and he was benched before the ink dried. If the Dolphins want to move on? That's $99.2 million in dead cap to cut him. Nearly a hundred million dollars for a player who isn't even starting.

Kirk Cousins signed a $180 million deal with Atlanta and was benched in favor of Michael Penix Jr., the team's first-round pick. The Falcons are now expected to release Cousins, eating a massive dead cap hit in the process, because the contract was structured in a way that makes it impossible to keep him at that price while developing the quarterback of the future.

This isn't an anomaly. This is a pattern. And the pattern is accelerating.

## The Math Doesn't Work

Here's the fundamental issue: quarterback salaries have grown at nearly 2.5 times the rate of the salary cap. From 2018 to 2023, the average top quarterback salary grew by approximately 64%. During that same period, the salary cap grew by only 26.5%. That gap is enormous, and it's getting wider every year.

When you devote 20-25% of your cap to one player, you are making a mathematical decision to be worse at every other position. You can't have an elite offensive line and an elite secondary and an elite pass rush when your quarterback is eating a quarter of the pie. Something has to give. And usually, what gives is depth -- the third corner, the fourth pass rusher, the quality backup, the reliable tight end. The positions that don't make headlines but win playoff games.

And here's the thing that drives me insane: the evidence that this approach wins championships is basically nonexistent.

## The Championship Evidence

Let's look at recent Super Bowl winners and their quarterback cap situations:

Sam Darnold won Super Bowl LX for the Minnesota Vikings with a cap hit of $13.4 million. Thirteen million. That's less than what some backup quarterbacks make. The Vikings built one of the deepest rosters in the league precisely because they weren't paying their quarterback like a top-five player.

Before that, the Eagles won with Jalen Hurts at a $13.6 million cap hit -- still on his rookie-scale deal. The Eagles loaded up on talent at every other position: A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, Haason Reddick, a dominant offensive line. They could afford to do all of that because Hurts was cheap.

Patrick Mahomes won Super Bowl LIV on his rookie contract. The Chiefs surrounded him with weapons -- Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, a competent offensive line -- because they had the cap flexibility to do so. Even Mahomes's subsequent mega-deal has been cleverly structured to keep his cap hits manageable, but the point stands: the championship was won when he was cheap.

The Buccaneers won with Tom Brady at a team-friendly deal. The Rams won with Matthew Stafford at a relatively reasonable cap hit. The pattern is overwhelming: you win Super Bowls when your quarterback isn't devouring a quarter of the cap.

## The Dead Cap Trap

What makes the current landscape truly terrifying is the dead cap problem. Teams aren't just overpaying quarterbacks -- they're locking themselves into contracts that make it nearly impossible to move on when things go wrong.

The dead cap numbers are obscene. Watson's $172 million. Tua's $99.2 million. These aren't just financial penalties; they're organizational death sentences. When you can't move on from a bad quarterback contract, you can't rebuild. You can't pivot. You're stuck in purgatory, too bad to contend but too hamstrung to tear it down and start over.

Denver provides the cautionary tale and, ironically, the roadmap. The Broncos ate $85 million in dead cap to escape the Russell Wilson contract. $85 million. That's an insane amount of money to pay a player not to play for you. But you know what happened after Denver ripped off the band-aid? They immediately made the playoffs. Twice. Because they could finally allocate their cap space to building a complete roster instead of propping up a declining quarterback.

The lesson from Denver is clear: sometimes the best move is the painful one. But most organizations don't have the stomach to eat that kind of dead cap, so they convince themselves that the quarterback will turn it around, that next year will be different, that the investment will pay off eventually. And the years pass, and the windows close, and the franchise is stuck.

## The Counter-Argument

I'll be fair. There's a legitimate counter-argument here. The salary cap keeps rising -- it's projected to hit $300 million within the next few years. Positional scarcity is real; there are only so many franchise quarterbacks in the world, and if you don't pay yours, someone else will. And the alternative -- cycling through average quarterbacks on medium-sized deals -- has its own risks. Ask the Bears. Ask the Jets. Ask any franchise that's spent a decade searching for "the guy."

And yes, eventually, some of these massive deals will look reasonable as the cap catches up. Mahomes's contract, which seemed insane at the time, already looks like a bargain because of cap inflation.

But here's my response: paying your quarterback isn't the problem. Paying the wrong quarterback is the problem. And right now, the NFL is full of teams paying the wrong quarterback and having no escape route.

## The Path Forward

The model is staring everyone in the face. Draft a quarterback. Develop him. Win during the rookie contract window while your cap flexibility is at its peak. And if he's truly a franchise quarterback, structure the extension carefully -- backload it, use void years, keep the early cap hits manageable.

What you don't do is hand out fully guaranteed $230 million deals to quarterbacks who haven't won a playoff game for your franchise. What you don't do is give $212 million to a quarterback with documented injury concerns. What you don't do is sign a 31-year-old to $180 million when you've already drafted his replacement.

The evidence is overwhelming. The Super Bowl winners of the last five years have had one thing in common: a cap-friendly quarterback situation that allowed them to build a complete roster. The teams currently drowning in quarterback cap hell have one thing in common too: they're not winning anything.

The NFL's quarterback salary spiral is unsustainable. And until front offices start learning from the evidence instead of the fear of losing their guy, it's only going to get worse.
