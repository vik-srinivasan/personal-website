            <h1>I Love What the Wizards Are Doing</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">By Vikram Srinivasan &middot; June 26, 2024</p>

            <h2>A Long Time Coming</h2>
            <p>
              As a DC native and lifelong Wizards fan, I've come to accept a
              certain level of heartbreak. Whether it was Gilbert Arenas's knee,
              John Wall's Achilles, or the countless seasons spent spinning our
              wheels in mediocrity, the Wizards have spent the better part of
              two decades trapped in basketball purgatory. Since 2018, the team
              has made the playoffs just once - in 2021, when Russell Westbrook
              briefly brought his chaos magic to town - and even then, they
              bowed out in five games. In fact, the franchise has made it past
              the first round of the playoffs only three times this century.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most of that time, the front office operated with no real
              vision. No move better summed up that dysfunction than the
              decision in 2022 to give Bradley Beal a 5-year, $251 million
              supermax contract, with a full no-trade clause. Not a partial
              clause. Not a list of teams. A full veto over any deal. Beal
              became just the second player in the entire NBA with that level of
              control - the other being LeBron James. Beal, while a talented
              scorer, was already 29, had never made an All-NBA First Team, and
              the Wizards were nowhere close to contending. It was a desperate
              attempt to cling to star power, rather than face the hard truth
              that a rebuild was necessary.
            </p>
            <p>But finally, the tide is turning.</p>
            <p>
              In 2023, the Wizards brought in Will Dawkins, a Sam Presti
              disciple and key architect of the OKC Thunder's rebuild, as
              General Manager. In 2024, Brian Keefe took over as head coach. For
              the first time in years, the Wizards have a direction. They're not
              trying to sneak into the play-in tournament or overpay middling
              stars. They're starting from scratch, the right way: stockpiling
              picks, developing young talent, and committing to a culture of
              growth and patience.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the first time in a long time, there's a plan in place - and
              it actually makes sense.
            </p>

            <h2>The Young Core: A Foundation for the Future</h2>
            <p>
              When you're rebuilding in today's NBA, you need more than just
              draft picks — you need to hit on them. The Wizards haven’t just
              embraced the rebuild; they’ve gone all-in, and the early returns
              are promising. Between savvy draft-day moves and opportunistic
              trades, Washington now boasts one of the deepest, most intriguing
              collections of young talent in the league.
            </p>
            <p>Let's break it down by position:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Guards
                <ul>
                  <li>Tre Johnson (Age: 19, Draft: 2025 #6)</li>
                  <p>
                    The most offensively gifted player on the roster, Johnson
                    brings a rare blend of shot creation, footwork, and scoring
                    instincts that give him true offensive superstar potential.
                    He can get buckets at all three levels and already looks
                    comfortable with the ball in his hands.
                  </p>
                  <li>Bub Carrington (Age: 19, Draft: 2024 #14)</li>
                  <p>
                    A tall, fluid point guard with advanced vision and feel.
                    Carrington is being groomed as the team’s long-term lead
                    guard, and the front office is giving him every opportunity
                    to develop through real NBA reps, starting with heavy usage
                    in Summer League.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    AJ Johnson (Age: 20, Draft: 2024 #23 – Acquired from Bucks
                    for Kyle Kuzma)
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Explosive and shifty, Johnson is a high-upside project with
                    twitchy athleticism and serious shot creation flashes. For a
                    late first-round pick acquired by flipping a veteran, he
                    represents a swing worth taking.
                  </p>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Wings
                <ul>
                  <li>Bilal Coulibaly (Age: 20, Draft: 2023 #7)</li>
                  <p>
                    Already a defensive weapon, Coulibaly uses his wingspan and
                    instincts to disrupt passing lanes and guard multiple
                    positions. His offensive game is still developing, but the
                    defensive ceiling is extremely high.
                  </p>
                  <li>Kyshawn George (Age: 21, Draft: 2024 #24)</li>
                  <p>
                    George fits the mold of the modern 3-and-D wing: versatile,
                    smart, and smooth. He’s got a clean shooting stroke and the
                    physical tools to guard multiple positions. The type of
                    plug-and-play role player every good team needs.
                  </p>
                  <li>Will Riley (Age: 19, Draft: 2025 #21)</li>
                  <p>
                    One of the youngest players in his class, Riley is a raw but
                    tantalizing athlete. He’s a long-term project, but he’s
                    already shown glimpses of explosive shot creation and
                    high-level scoring instincts.
                  </p>
                  <li>Jamir Watkins (Age: 24, Draft: 2025 #42)</li>
                  <p>
                    A mature, do-it-all wing with defensive toughness,
                    rebounding instincts, and a competitive edge. Watkins may
                    not have the highest ceiling, but he brings a strong
                    foundation for rotation minutes right away.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Cam Whitmore (Age: 21, Draft: 2023 #20 – Acquired from
                    Rockets for two second-round picks)
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Whitmore is a walking bucket. His combination of strength,
                    burst, and scoring mentality gives him real star upside.
                    Getting a player of his caliber for just two second-round
                    picks is one of the savviest moves this front office has
                    made.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Dillon Jones (Age: 23, Draft: 2024 #26 – Acquired from
                    Thunder for essentially nothing)
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    A jack-of-all-trades forward with a strong frame and
                    advanced feel. He rebounds, defends, and moves the ball well
                    – a winning player with upside as a rotation staple.
                  </p>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Bigs
                <ul>
                  <li>Alex Sarr (Age: 20, Draft: 2024 #2)</li>
                  <p>
                    The centerpiece of the rebuild. At 7’1” with elite mobility,
                    Sarr already shows flashes of dominant defense:
                    switchability, rim protection, and shot disruption. His
                    floor is high, and if he continues to develop, he projects
                    as a perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate.
                  </p>
                  <li>Tristan Vukčević (Age: 22, Draft: 2023 #42)</li>
                  <p>
                    A stretch big with touch and feel. Vukčević gives the
                    Wizards spacing in the frontcourt and has the potential to
                    complement Sarr as a pick-and-pop partner or second-unit
                    offensive weapon.
                  </p>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Taken together, this is one of the deepest young rosters in the
              league, and a clear sign of how aggressively the Wizards have
              leaned into the rebuild. They now have 7 first-round picks from
              just the past two drafts on the roster, and 11 first-rounders from
              the last four drafts when you include recent trade acquisitions
              Malaki Branham and Blake Wesley. That kind of youth density isn’t
              just rare, it’s intentional. Washington isn’t hoarding prospects
              for the sake of it; they’re building a developmental ecosystem
              where players grow together, compete for minutes, and elevate the
              standard internally. It’s a long game, but it’s the right one.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Veteran Leadership & Trade Chips: Smart Moves, On and Off the
              Court
            </h2>
            <p>
              For a rebuilding team, veterans often serve one of two purposes:
              they either clog up developmental minutes or they help set the
              tone. The Wizards have chosen the latter, and done so with
              impressive precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past year, Washington brought in CJ McCollum, Marcus
              Smart, and Khris Middleton, not to chase wins, but to build
              culture. These are battle-tested veterans - former All-Stars,
              champions, and respected locker room voices - who know what
              professionalism looks like at the highest level. Their role isn’t
              to carry the offense or take away shots from the young guys. It’s
              to mentor, guide, and elevate the standard.
            </p>
            <p>
              CJ McCollum gives young guards like Bub Carrington and Tre Johnson
              a blueprint for how to succeed in the league. He’s a cerebral
              scorer, a former NBPA president, and someone who can show
              Carrington how to lead without dominating. Marcus Smart brings
              championship pedigree and relentless intensity. No one in the
              league is better equipped to teach Bilal Coulibaly and Kyshawn
              George the nuances of defensive versatility and winning effort.
              His voice carries weight, and so does his example. Khris
              Middleton, a silky mid-range scorer and two-time All-Star, adds a
              level of polish and spacing that complements young wings while
              providing a professional model of shot selection and team-first
              play.
            </p>
            <p>
              But here’s where the front office has really played this right:
              all three veterans are on expiring contracts, giving the team
              maximum flexibility. Middleton, Smart, and McCollum’s deals are up
              after this season, making them valuable trade chips at the
              deadline or clean exits off the books next summer. It’s the exact
              blueprint the Wizards used to turn Kyle Kuzma into AJ Johnson last
              year: move veterans at peak value, create cap space, and add to
              the asset pool.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s what makes this approach so modern, and so smart. The
              Wizards are leveraging their cap space, not to overpay for
              empty-calorie stats, but to absorb salary and pick up assets along
              the way. Take the Jordan Poole for CJ McCollum swap, for example.
              Poole still had two more guaranteed years on his deal and clearly
              didn’t fit the team’s timeline. By flipping him for McCollum, the
              Wizards not only got an expiring contract and a respected veteran
              voice, they also picked up additional draft compensation. It was a
              textbook move: clear the books, improve the culture, and add to
              the asset chest.
            </p>
            <p>
              In today’s NBA, rebuilding is just as much about managing
              contracts as it is about developing players. And right now, the
              Wizards are doing both at a high level.
            </p>

            <h2>Draft Capital Arsenal: Loaded for the Future</h2>
            <p>
              A successful rebuild doesn’t just depend on the players you draft,
              it depends on when you draft, how many chances you give yourself,
              and whether your front office knows how to extract value from the
              margins. The Wizards, for once, are checking all three boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Washington’s draft pick situation is as promising as any
              non-contending team in the league. Their own 2026 first-round pick
              is top-8 protected, which means there’s a very real incentive to
              continue prioritizing development and letting the young core take
              its lumps. And that pick could come at just the right time: the
              2026 NBA Draft is shaping up to be a generational class.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top three prospects - Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa, and
              Cameron Boozer - all project as franchise altering players. Any
              one of them would immediately become the number one option in
              Washington and serve as a defining turning point in the rebuild.
              Beyond that trio, the class is stacked with high-upside talent:
              Nate Ament, Mikel Brown, and Jayden Quaintance all carry All-Star
              potential. This makes the Wizards’ goal clear: be bad enough to
              stay in the top 8 and give yourself a shot at one of these
              cornerstones.
            </p>
            <p>
              And even if lottery luck doesn’t go their way, they’ve got a
              second first-round pick coming in 2026, via a pick swap that gives
              them the worst of Houston, Oklahoma City, or the Clippers.
              Although this pick isn’t projected to be high, as both OKC and
              Houston have title aspirations, it gives Washington an extra shot
              at finding value in what may be a stacked first round.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it’s not just first-round picks that matter. The Wizards also
              own a whopping eight second-rounders in the next two drafts, and
              they’ve already shown a willingness to use those picks creatively.
              This offseason, they sent two seconds to Houston to acquire Cam
              Whitmore, a 2023 lottery talent who’s already looked like a
              potential stud. They’ve used second-rounders to move up in the
              draft, to target overlooked talent, and to grease the wheels of
              bigger trades. It’s a level of optionality that many teams don’t
              have, and Washington is wielding it with purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps most importantly, this draft flexibility comes at a time
              when the books are about to clear. The contracts of CJ McCollum,
              Marcus Smart, and Khris Middleton all expire after the 2025–26
              season, giving Washington maximum financial flexibility heading
              into the 2026 offseason. That perfectly aligns with the arrival of
              a potential franchise cornerstone from the 2026 draft. By then,
              the young core will have multiple full seasons of development
              under their belt, and the front office will be positioned to
              aggressively pursue top-tier free agents to complement the
              foundation. The 2026–27 season is shaping up to be the moment
              everything comes together: where the rebuild stops being
              theoretical and starts becoming real.

            <p>
              Rebuilding is never pretty, but when done right, it’s purposeful.
              The Wizards are proving that you don’t have to bottom out in
              chaos. You can tank efficiently, intentionally, and strategically.
              That’s exactly what this front office is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The decisions to move on from Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma weren’t
              just about clearing cap space, they were about clearing the path
              for the future. Poole, despite his scoring outbursts, never fit
              the timeline and still had two more years of guaranteed money.
              Kuzma, a productive veteran, was soaking up usage that needed to
              be redistributed. By flipping them, the Wizards opened up minutes
              and on-ball reps for their young players, and brought back real
              value in the form of AJ Johnson, CJ McCollum, and draft capital.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, instead of watching misaligned vets take 20 shots a night,
              the Wizards are investing in real development. Bub Carrington is
              learning point guard duties the hard way - through reps, mistakes,
              and responsibility. He’s getting thrown into situations where he
              has to read defenses, organize the offense, and lead. It won’t
              always be pretty, but it will matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alex Sarr, meanwhile, is being thrown directly into the fire. The
              Wizards didn’t just hand him a starting role, they gave him no
              real safety net. With Marvin Bagley III and Tristan Vukčević as
              the only other playable bigs, Sarr is learning the NBA game by
              anchoring the defense, contesting shots, switching on the
              perimeter, and battling bigger bodies night in and night out.
              There’s no hiding, only growing.
            </p>
            <p>And that might be the point.</p>
            <p>
              Washington’s frontcourt depth problem doesn’t look like an
              accident. It’s likely a subtle and smart tanking strategy. A thin
              rotation of big men means fewer rebounds, more defensive
              breakdowns, and more losses. But those losses come with valuable
              developmental reps for young players who are being challenged to
              do more than they’re ready for, and that’s exactly how you
              accelerate growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the OKC and Houston model: prioritize experience over
              efficiency, let your young core make mistakes, and live with the
              results. Don’t chase wins that don’t mean anything. Chase reps.
              Chase lessons. Chase growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wizards aren’t trying to win 35 games. They’re trying to build
              a team that can win 60 eventually. And every uncomfortable minute
              for a 19-year-old guard or a 20-year-old big is a down payment on
              that future.
            </p>

            <h2>Culture Reboot: A New DC Identity</h2>
            <p>
              For years, the Washington Wizards felt like a team without a
              pulse. The culture was reactive, not proactive - stuck in a cycle
              of half-measures and hollow optimism. There was no clear
              philosophy, no sense of identity, and certainly no buzz around the
              league. But that’s starting to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The culture shift in DC is real, and it’s happening from the top
              down.
            </p>
            <p>
              It starts with the organization’s investment in infrastructure.
              Monumental Sports made the decision to keep the team in the city,
              with new plans for revamping Capital One Arena and building a
              state-of-the-art practice facility. In a league where training
              resources and stability can shape a rebuild, that commitment
              matters, especially to young players deciding where they want to
              grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wizards didn’t stop there. They turned heads at Summer League
              this year by building a private practice court in a Las Vegas
              ballroom, giving their players a dedicated space to train, bond,
              and build chemistry away from the chaos of the main gyms. That
              level of attention to detail sends a message: development is the
              priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the buy-in isn’t just coming from coaches and executives, it’s
              coming from players, too. Marcus Smart and Bilal Coulibaly showed
              up to Vegas, despite not being on the Summer League roster, to
              support the young guys and help build camaraderie. That kind of
              presence doesn’t happen on accident - it’s a sign that people want
              to be part of what’s being built.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even more telling? Players around the league are starting to treat
              Washington like a destination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alex Sarr, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 draft, declined a
              workout with Atlanta, who held the No. 1 pick, because he wanted
              to come to DC. Cam Whitmore, a DMV native, and his camp worked
              behind the scenes to engineer a trade home from Houston. Ace
              Bailey, projected as a top-5 pick in the 2025 draft, reportedly
              hoped to land in Washington and refused workouts with teams
              drafting higher, a move that nearly worked, as he ultimately went
              No. 5 to Utah.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s not a coincidence. That’s momentum. And momentum matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              After years of listless basketball and lukewarm fan energy,
              there’s finally a feeling of purpose around this team. For the
              first time in a long time, the fanbase is excited - not because
              the Wizards are chasing the 8-seed, but because there’s a clear
              plan, a compelling young core, and an organization doing things
              the right way. There’s a real breath of fresh air in DC, and it’s
              being felt everywhere from the front office to the floor seats.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wizards haven’t just reset the roster. They’ve reset the tone.
            </p>

            <h2>A Reason to Believe</h2>
            <p>
              For the first time in what feels like forever, being a Wizards fan
              doesn’t mean clinging to false hope or squinting to find upside in
              mediocrity. It means watching a plan unfold. A real plan: one
              rooted in long-term vision, player development, and smart asset
              management.
            </p>
            <p>
              This team isn’t trying to skip steps or slap together a short-term
              contender. It’s embracing the grind. The front office is being
              patient, deliberate, and forward-thinking. The coaching staff is
              empowering youth. The veterans are here to guide, not overshadow.
              And the infrastructure, from private Vegas courts to a revamped
              arena, reflects a franchise finally investing in itself the right
              way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, there are no guarantees in a rebuild. Prospects miss.
              Picks don’t always convey. And growth isn’t always linear. But
              what’s different now is that the Wizards are earning their
              optimism. They’re building something sustainable - not just in
              terms of talent, but in terms of identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a DC native, I’ve never felt this way about the team. Not
              during the Arenas years, not during Wall and Beal’s peak, and
              certainly not during the Poole/ Kuzma experiment. For once, it
              feels like we’re not just chasing the next headline or hanging our
              hopes on one player. We’re building something bigger.
            </p>
            <p>
              It won’t happen overnight. But the foundation is there. The pieces
              are in place. And for the first time in a long time, I can say
              this with confidence: I love what the Wizards are doing.
